## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does the 14-day trial work?

When you first launch the desktop app, your 14-day trial starts automatically. No credit card required. You get full access to all features. After 14 days, you'll need to purchase a $40 license to continue using the app.

### What happens after 1 year?

Your license never expires. After 1 year, you can continue using your current version indefinitely. Updates are optional — if you want the latest features, you can renew for another year of updates.

### Can I use PostPilot on multiple devices?

The $40 license is for 1 device. Each license is tied to your device's hardware fingerprint. If you need to use PostPilot on multiple devices, you'll need a separate license for each device.

### What if I change my computer?

Contact us at anlac96.it@gmail.com if you need to transfer your license to a new device (e.g., hardware upgrade, new computer).

### Do I need an internet connection?

The desktop app requires periodic online verification to validate your license. Once verified, you can work offline.

### Is my data secure and private?

Yes! All your workspace data is stored locally on your device's file system. We never collect or access your API requests, database queries, or any sensitive data. See our [Privacy Policy](https://www.postpilot.dev/privacy-policy) for details.

### Can I get a refund?

Our refund policy is as displayed at time of purchase. Since PostPilot is downloadable software with a 14-day free trial, we encourage you to fully evaluate the app during the trial period before purchasing.
